# Implement - Execute Task Plan

Execute tasks from the plan, track progress, and enable session continuation.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check Current State

**FIRST:** Determine what state we're in:

```
1. Parse arguments:
   - --list → list available plans only (no implementation; STOP)
   - @<path> → explicit plan file override (highest priority)
   - <number> → start from specific task
   - status → status-only mode
2. Check for uncommitted changes (git status)
3. Check current branch
```

### Step 0.list: List Available Plans (`--list`)

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--list`, run read-only plan discovery and stop.

```
1. Get current branch:
   git branch --show-current
2. Convert branch to filename: replace "/" with "-", add ".md"
3. Check existence of:
   - .ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md
   - .ai-factory/PLAN.md
   - .ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md
4. Print plan availability summary and usage hints
5. STOP.
```

**Important:** In `--list` mode:
- Do not execute tasks
- Do not modify files
- Do not update TaskList statuses

For detailed output format and examples, see:
- `skills/aif-implement/references/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` → "List Available Plans (`--list`)"

### Step 0.0: Resume / Recovery (after a break or after /clear)

If the user is resuming **the next day**, says the session was **abandoned**, or you suspect context was lost (e.g. after `/clear`), rebuild local context from the repo **before** continuing tasks:

```
1. git status
2. git branch --show-current
3. git log --oneline --decorate -20
4. (optional) git diff --stat
5. (optional) git stash list
```

Then reconcile plan/task state:
- Ensure the current plan file matches the current branch (`@plan-file` override wins; otherwise branch-named plan takes priority over `PLAN.md`).
- Compare `TaskList` statuses vs plan checkboxes.
  - If code changes for a task appear already implemented but the task is not marked completed, verify quickly and then `TaskUpdate(..., status: "completed")` and update the plan checkbox.
  - If a task is marked completed but the corresponding code is missing (rebase/reset happened), mark it back to pending and discuss with the user.

**If uncommitted changes exist:**
```
AskUserQuestion: You have uncommitted changes. Commit them first?

Options:
1. Yes, commit now (/aif-commit)
2. No, stash and continue
3. Cancel
```

**Based on choice:**
- Yes → run `/aif-commit`, then continue to plan discovery
- No → `git stash push -m "aif-implement: stash before plan execution"`, then continue
- Cancel → inform the user: "Implementation cancelled." → **STOP**

**If NO plan file exists but `.ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md` exists:**

A fix plan was created by `/aif-fix` in plan mode. Redirect to fix workflow:

```
Found a fix plan (.ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md).

This plan was created by /aif-fix and should be executed through the fix workflow
(it creates a patch and handles cleanup automatically).

Running /aif-fix to execute the plan...
```

→ **Invoke `/aif-fix`** (without arguments — it will detect FIX_PLAN.md and execute it).
→ **STOP** — do not continue with implement workflow.

**If NO plan file exists AND no FIX_PLAN.md (all tasks completed or fresh start):**

```
AskUserQuestion: No active plan found. Current branch: <current-branch>.
What would you like to do?

Options:
1. Start new feature from current branch
2. Return to main/master and start new feature
3. Create quick task plan (no branch)
4. Nothing, just checking status
```

**Based on choice:**
- New feature from current → `/aif-plan full <description>`
- Return to main → `git checkout main`, then `git pull` → `/aif-plan full <description>`
- Quick task → `/aif-plan fast <description>`
- Nothing, just checking status → display branch info and recent commits summary → **STOP**

**If plan file exists → continue to Step 0.1**

### Step 0.1: Load Project Context & Past Experience

**Read `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`** if it exists to understand:
- Tech stack (language, framework, database, ORM)
- Project architecture and conventions
- Non-functional requirements

**Read `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`** if it exists to understand:
- Chosen architecture pattern and folder structure
- Dependency rules (what depends on what)
- Layer/module boundaries and communication patterns
- Follow these conventions when implementing — file placement, imports, module boundaries

**Read `.ai-factory/RULES.md`** if it exists:
- These are project-specific rules and conventions added by the user
- **ALWAYS follow these rules** when implementing — they override general patterns
- Rules are short, actionable — treat each as a hard requirement

**Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-implement/SKILL.md`** — MANDATORY if the file exists.

This file contains project-specific rules accumulated by `/aif-evolve` from patches,
codebase conventions, and tech-stack analysis. These rules are tailored to the current project.

**How to apply skill-context rules:**
- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins** (more specific context takes priority — same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files)
- When there is no conflict, apply both: general rules from SKILL.md + project rules from skill-context
- Do NOT ignore skill-context rules even if they seem to contradict this skill's defaults —
  they exist because the project's experience proved the default insufficient
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill — including the code
  you write and how you update plan checkboxes. If a skill-context rule says "code MUST follow X"
  or "implementation MUST include Y" — you MUST comply. Writing code that violates skill-context
  rules is a bug.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated — fix the output before presenting it to the user.

**Patch fallback (limited, only when skill-context is missing):**

- If `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-implement/SKILL.md` does not exist and `.ai-factory/patches/` exists:
  - Use `Glob` to find `*.md` files in `.ai-factory/patches/`
  - Sort patch filenames ascending (lexical), then select the last **10** (or fewer if less exist)
  - Read those selected patch files only
  - Prioritize **Root Cause** and **Prevention** sections
- If skill-context exists, do **not** read all patches by default.
  - Optionally read a few targeted recent patches only when a task clearly matches a known failure pattern.

**Use this context when implementing:**
- Follow the specified tech stack
- Use correct import patterns and conventions
- Apply proper error handling and logging as specified
- Avoid pitfalls documented in skill-context rules and relevant fallback patches

### Step 0.2: Find Plan File

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `@<path>`:**

Use this explicit plan file and skip automatic plan discovery.

```
1. Extract path after "@"
2. Resolve relative to project root (absolute paths are also valid)
3. If file does not exist:
   "Plan file not found: <path>
    Provide an existing markdown plan file, for example:
    - /aif-implement @.ai-factory/PLAN.md
    - /aif-implement @.ai-factory/plans/feature-user-auth.md"
   → STOP
4. If file is .ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md:
   → invoke /aif-fix (ownership + cleanup workflow) and STOP
5. Otherwise use this file as the active plan
```

Then continue with normal execution using the selected plan file.

**If no `@<path>` override is provided, check plan files in this order:**

**Check for plan files in this order:**

```
1. Check current git branch:
   git branch --show-current
   → Convert branch name to filename: replace "/" with "-", add ".md"
   → Look for .ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md (e.g., feature/user-auth → .ai-factory/plans/feature-user-auth.md)
2. No branch-based plan → Check .ai-factory/PLAN.md
3. No branch-based plan and no .ai-factory/PLAN.md → Check .ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md
   → If exists: invoke /aif-fix (handles its own workflow with patches) and STOP
```

**Priority:**
1. `@<path>` argument - explicit user-selected plan file
2. Branch-named file (from `/aif-plan full`) - if it matches current branch
3. `.ai-factory/PLAN.md` (from `/aif-plan fast`) - fallback when no branch-based plan exists
4. `.ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md` - redirect to `/aif-fix` (from `/aif-fix` plan mode)

**Read the plan file** to understand:
- Context and settings (testing, logging preferences)
- Commit checkpoints (when to commit)
- Task dependencies
- Task checklist format (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) to keep progress synced

### Step 1: Load Current State

```
TaskList → Get all tasks with status
```

Find:
- Next pending task (not blocked, not completed)
- Any in_progress tasks (resume these first)

### Step 2: Display Progress

```
## Implementation Progress

✅ Completed: 3/8 tasks
🔄 In Progress: Task #4 - Implement search service
⏳ Pending: 4 tasks

Current task: #4 - Implement search service
```

### Step 3: Execute Current Task

For each task:

**3.1: Fetch full details**
```
TaskGet(taskId) → Get description, files, context
```

**3.2: Mark as in_progress**
```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "in_progress")
```

**3.3: Implement the task**
- Read relevant files
- Make necessary changes
- Follow existing code patterns
- **NO tests unless plan includes test tasks**
- **NO reports or summaries**

**3.4: Verify implementation**
- Check code compiles/runs
- Verify functionality works
- Fix any immediate issues

**3.5: Mark as completed**
```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "completed")
```

**3.6: Update checkbox in plan file**

**IMMEDIATELY** after completing a task, update the checkbox in the plan file:

```markdown
# Before
- [ ] Task 1: Create user model

# After
- [x] Task 1: Create user model
```

**This is MANDATORY** — checkboxes must reflect actual progress:
- Use `Edit` tool to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Do this RIGHT AFTER each task completion
- Even if deletion will be offered later
- Plan file is the source of truth for progress

**3.7: Update .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md if needed**

If during implementation:
- New dependency/library was added
- Tech stack changed (e.g., added Redis, switched ORM)
- New integration added (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid)
- Architecture decision was made

→ Update `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` to reflect the change:

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- **Cache:** Redis (added for session storage)
```

This keeps .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md as the source of truth.

**3.7.1: Update AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md if project structure changed**

If during implementation:
- New directories or modules were created
- Project structure changed significantly (new `src/modules/`, new API routes directory, etc.)
- New entry points or key files were added

→ Update `AGENTS.md` — refresh the "Project Structure" tree and "Key Entry Points" table to reflect new directories/files.

→ Update `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` — if new modules or layers were added that should be documented in the folder structure section.

**Only update if structure actually changed** — don't rewrite on every task. Check if new directories were created that aren't in the current structure map.

**3.8: Check for commit checkpoint**

If the plan has commit checkpoints and current task is at a checkpoint:
```
AskUserQuestion: ✅ Tasks <first>-<last> completed. This is a commit checkpoint. Ready to commit? Suggested message: "<conventional commit message>"

Options:
1. Yes, commit now (/aif-commit)
2. No, continue to next task
3. Skip all commit checkpoints
```

**Based on choice:**
- Yes, commit now → invoke `/aif-commit` with the suggested message, then continue to next task
- No, continue to next task → proceed to the next task without committing
- Skip all commit checkpoints → for all subsequent checkpoints within this `/aif-implement` run, skip the prompt automatically and proceed directly to the next task (as if user selected "No, continue to next task" each time). This is in-context memory — resets on `/clear` or new session

**3.9: Move to next task or pause**

### Step 4: Session Persistence

Progress is automatically saved via TaskUpdate.

**To pause:**
```
Current progress saved.

Completed: 4/8 tasks
Next task: #5 - Add pagination support

To resume later, run:
/aif-implement
```

**To resume (next session):**
```
/aif-implement
```
→ Automatically finds next incomplete task

### Step 5: Completion

When all tasks are done:

```
## Implementation Complete

All 8 tasks completed.

Branch: feature/product-search
Plan file: .ai-factory/plans/feature-product-search.md
Files modified:
- src/services/search.ts (created)
- src/api/products/search.ts (created)
- src/types/search.ts (created)
Documentation: updated existing docs | created docs/<feature-slug>.md | skipped by user | warn-only (Docs: no/unset)

What's next?

1. 🔍 /aif-verify — Verify nothing was missed (recommended)
2. 💾 /aif-commit — Commit the changes directly
```

**Check ROADMAP.md progress:**

If `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists:
1. Read it
1.1. If the plan file includes `## Roadmap Linkage` with a non-`none` milestone, prefer that milestone for completion marking
2. Check if the completed work corresponds to any unchecked milestone
3. If yes — mark it `[x]` and add entry to the Completed table with today's date
4. Tell the user which milestone was marked done

### Context Maintenance (Artifacts)

Only do this step when there is something concrete to capture.

**DESCRIPTION.md (allowed in this command):**
- If this plan introduced new dependencies/integrations or changed the stack, update `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` with factual deltas only.
- Do not rewrite unrelated sections.

**ARCHITECTURE.md + AGENTS.md (allowed in this command):**
- If new modules/layers/folders were added (or dependency rules changed), update `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the new structure and constraints.
- If you maintain `AGENTS.md` structure maps or entry points, refresh them only when they are now incorrect.

**ROADMAP.md (allowed, limited):**
- This command may mark milestone completion when evidence is clear.
- If milestone mapping is ambiguous, emit `WARN [roadmap] ...` and suggest the owner command:
  - `/aif-roadmap check`
  - or `/aif-roadmap <short update request>`

**RULES.md (NOT allowed in this command):**
- Never edit `.ai-factory/RULES.md` from `/aif-implement`.
- If you discovered repeatable conventions/pitfalls during implementation, propose up to 3 candidate rules and ask the user to add them via `/aif-rules`.
- Do not invoke `/aif-rules` automatically (it is user-invoked).

If candidate rules exist:

```
AskUserQuestion: Capture new project rules in `.ai-factory/RULES.md`?

Options:
1. Yes — output `/aif-rules ...` commands (recommended)
2. No — skip
```

**Documentation policy checkpoint (after completion, before plan cleanup):**

Read the plan file setting `Docs: yes/no`.

If plan setting is `Docs: yes`:
```
AskUserQuestion: Documentation checkpoint — how should we document this feature?

Options:
1. Update existing docs (recommended) — invoke /aif-docs
2. Create a new feature doc page — invoke /aif-docs with feature-page context
3. Skip documentation
```

Handling:
- Option 1 → invoke `/aif-docs` to update README/docs based on completed work
- Option 2 → invoke `/aif-docs` with context to create `docs/<feature-slug>.md`, include sections (Summary, Usage/user-facing behavior, Configuration, API/CLI changes, Examples, Troubleshooting, See Also), and add a README docs-table link
- Option 3 → do not invoke `/aif-docs`; emit `WARN [docs] Documentation skipped by user`

If plan setting is `Docs: no` or setting is unset:
- Do **not** show a mandatory docs checkpoint prompt
- Do **not** invoke `/aif-docs` automatically
- Emit `WARN [docs] Docs policy is no/unset; skipping documentation checkpoint`

**Always include documentation outcome in the final completion output:**
- `Documentation: updated existing docs`
- `Documentation: created docs/<feature-slug>.md`
- `Documentation: skipped by user`
- `Documentation: warn-only (Docs: no/unset)`

**Handle plan file after completion:**

- **If `.ai-factory/PLAN.md`** (from `/aif-plan fast`):
  ```
  AskUserQuestion: Would you like to delete .ai-factory/PLAN.md? (It's no longer needed)

  Options:
  1. Yes, delete it
  2. No, keep it
  ```

  **Based on choice:**
  - "Yes, delete it" → delete the file:
    ```bash
    rm .ai-factory/PLAN.md
    ```
  - "No, keep it" → leave the file as is, continue to the next step

- **If branch-named file** (e.g., `.ai-factory/plans/feature-user-auth.md`):
  - Keep it - documents what was done
  - User can delete before merging if desired

**Check if running in a git worktree:**

Detect worktree context:
```bash
# If .git is a file (not a directory), we're in a worktree
[ -f .git ]
```

**If we ARE in a worktree**, offer to merge back and clean up:

```
You're working in a parallel worktree.

  Branch:    <current-branch>
  Worktree:  <current-directory>
  Main repo: <main-repo-path>

AskUserQuestion: Would you like to merge this branch into main and clean up?

Options:
1. Yes, merge and clean up (recommended)
2. No, I'll handle it manually
```

**Based on choice:**
- "Yes, merge and clean up" → follow the Worktree Merge procedure below
- "No, I'll handle it manually" → show a reminder:
  ```
  To merge and clean up later:
    cd <main-repo-path>
    git merge <branch>
    /aif-plan --cleanup <branch>
  ```

#### Worktree Merge

1. **Ensure everything is committed** — check `git status`. If uncommitted changes exist, suggest `/aif-commit` first and wait.

2. **Get main repo path:**
   ```bash
   MAIN_REPO=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir | sed 's|/\.git$||')
   BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   ```

3. **Switch to main repo:**
   ```bash
   cd "${MAIN_REPO}"
   ```

4. **Merge the branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge "${BRANCH}"
   ```

   If merge conflict occurs:
   ```
   ⚠️  Merge conflict detected. Resolve manually:
     cd <main-repo-path>
     git merge --abort   # to cancel
     # or resolve conflicts and git commit
   ```
   → STOP here, do not proceed with cleanup.

5. **Remove worktree and branch (only if merge succeeded):**
   ```bash
   git worktree remove <worktree-path>
   git branch -d "${BRANCH}"
   ```

6. **Confirm:**
   ```
   ✅ Merged and cleaned up!

     Branch <branch> merged into main.
     Worktree removed.

   You're now in: <main-repo-path> (main)
   ```

→ **STOP** — worktree merged and removed, no further steps needed.

### Final Step — Verify or Commit

```
AskUserQuestion: All tasks complete. What's next?

Options:
1. Verify first — Run /aif-verify to check completeness (recommended)
2. Skip to commit — Go straight to /aif-commit
```

**Based on choice:**
- "Verify first" → invoke `/aif-verify` → after it completes, continue to context cleanup below
- "Skip to commit" → invoke `/aif-commit` → after it completes, continue to context cleanup below

**Context cleanup (after verify or commit):**

Suggest the user to free up context space if needed: `/clear` (full reset) or `/compact` (compress history).

**IMPORTANT: NO summary reports, NO analysis documents, NO wrap-up tasks.**

## Commands

### Start/Resume Implementation
```
/aif-implement
```
Continues from next incomplete task.

### List Available Plans
```
/aif-implement --list
```
Lists `.ai-factory/PLAN.md`, `.ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md`, and current-branch `.ai-factory/plans/<branch>.md` (if present), then exits without implementation.

### Use Explicit Plan File
```
/aif-implement @my-custom-plan.md
/aif-implement @.ai-factory/plans/feature-user-auth.md status
```
Uses the provided plan file instead of auto-detecting by branch/default files.

### Start from Specific Task
```
/aif-implement 5
```
Starts from task #5 (useful for skipping or re-doing).

### Check Status Only
```
/aif-implement status
```
Shows progress without executing.

## Execution Rules

### DO:
- ✅ Execute one task at a time
- ✅ Mark tasks in_progress before starting
- ✅ Mark tasks completed after finishing
- ✅ Follow existing code conventions
- ✅ Follow `/aif-best-practices` guidelines (naming, structure, error handling)
- ✅ Create files mentioned in task description
- ✅ Handle edge cases mentioned in task
- ✅ Stop and ask if task is unclear

### DON'T:
- ❌ Write tests (unless explicitly in task list)
- ❌ Create report files
- ❌ Create summary documents
- ❌ Add tasks not in the plan
- ❌ Skip tasks without user permission
- ❌ Mark incomplete tasks as done
- ❌ Violate `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` conventions for file placement and module boundaries

## Artifact Ownership Boundaries

- Primary ownership in this command: task execution state and plan progress checkboxes.
- Allowed context artifact updates: `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`, `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and roadmap milestone completion in `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` when implementation evidence justifies it.
- Read-only context in this command by default: `.ai-factory/RULES.md`, `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md`.
- Context-gate findings should be communicated as `WARN`/`ERROR` outputs only; this does not replace the required verbose implementation logging rules below.

For progress display format, blocker handling, session continuity examples, and full flow examples → see `references/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER write tests** unless task list explicitly includes test tasks
2. **NEVER create reports** or summary documents after completion
3. **ALWAYS mark task in_progress** before starting work
4. **ALWAYS mark task completed** after finishing
5. **ALWAYS update checkbox in plan file** - `- [ ]` → `- [x]` immediately after task completion
6. **PRESERVE progress** - tasks survive session boundaries
7. **ONE task at a time** - focus on current task only

## CRITICAL: Logging Requirements

**ALWAYS add verbose logging when implementing code.** For logging guidelines, patterns, and management requirements → read `references/LOGGING-GUIDE.md`

Key rules: log function entry/exit, state changes, external calls, error context. Use structured logging, configurable log levels (LOG_LEVEL env var).

**DO NOT skip logging to "keep code clean" - verbose logging is REQUIRED during implementation, but MUST be configurable.**
