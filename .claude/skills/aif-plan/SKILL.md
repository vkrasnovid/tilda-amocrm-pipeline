# Plan - Implementation Planning

Create an implementation plan for a feature or task. Two modes:
- **Fast** — quick plan, no git branch, saves to `.ai-factory/PLAN.md`
- **Full** — creates git branch, asks preferences, saves to `.ai-factory/plans/<branch>.md`

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Project Context

**FIRST:** Read `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` if it exists to understand:
- Tech stack (language, framework, database, ORM)
- Project architecture
- Coding conventions
- Non-functional requirements

**ALSO:** Read `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` if it exists to understand:
- Chosen architecture pattern
- Folder structure conventions
- Layer/module boundaries
- Dependency rules

Use this context when:
- Exploring codebase (know what patterns to look for)
- Writing task descriptions (use correct technologies)
- Planning file structure (follow project conventions)
- **Follow architecture guidelines from `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` when planning file structure and task organization**

**Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-plan/SKILL.md`** — MANDATORY if the file exists.

This file contains project-specific rules accumulated by `/aif-evolve` from patches,
codebase conventions, and tech-stack analysis. These rules are tailored to the current project.

**How to apply skill-context rules:**
- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins** (more specific context takes priority — same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files)
- When there is no conflict, apply both: general rules from SKILL.md + project rules from skill-context
- Do NOT ignore skill-context rules even if they seem to contradict this skill's defaults —
  they exist because the project's experience proved the default insufficient
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill — including the PLAN.md
  template and task format. The plan template from TASK-FORMAT.md is a **base structure**. If a
  skill-context rule says "tasks MUST include X" or "plan MUST have section Y" — you MUST augment
  the template accordingly. Generating a plan that violates skill-context rules is a bug.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated — fix the output before presenting it to the user.

**OPTIONAL (recommended):** Read `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` if it exists:
- Use it to link this plan to a specific milestone (when applicable)
- This reduces ambiguity in `/aif-implement` milestone completion and `/aif-verify` roadmap gates

**OPTIONAL (recommended):** Read `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md` if it exists:
- Treat `## Active Summary (input for /aif-plan)` as an additional requirements source
- Carry over constraints/decisions into tasks and plan settings
- Prefer the summary over raw notes; use `## Sessions` only when you need deeper rationale
- If the user omitted the feature description, use `Active Summary -> Topic:` as the default description

### Step 0.1: Ensure Git Repository

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null || git init
```

### Step 0.2: Parse Arguments & Select Mode

Extract flags and mode from `$ARGUMENTS`:

```
--parallel  → Enable parallel worktree mode (full mode only)
--list      → Show all active worktrees, then STOP
--cleanup <branch> → Remove worktree and optionally delete branch, then STOP
fast        → Fast mode (first word)
full        → Full mode (first word)
```

**Parsing rules:**
- Strip `--parallel`, `--list`, `--cleanup <branch>`, `fast`, `full` from `$ARGUMENTS`
- Remaining text becomes the description
- `--list` and `--cleanup` execute immediately and **STOP** (do NOT continue to Step 1+)

**If the description is empty:**
- If `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md` exists and its `Active Summary` has a non-empty `Topic:`, default the description to that topic (no extra user input required)
- Otherwise, ask the user for a short feature description

**If `--list` is present**, jump to [--list Subcommand](#--list-subcommand).
**If `--cleanup` is present**, jump to [--cleanup Subcommand](#--cleanup-subcommand).

**Mode selection:**
- `fast` keyword → fast mode
- `full` keyword → full mode
- Neither → ask interactively:

```
AskUserQuestion: Which planning mode?

Options:
1. Full (Recommended) — creates git branch, asks preferences, full plan
2. Fast — quick plan, no branch, saves to PLAN.md
```

If the user did not provide a description and `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md` exists:
- Mention that you will default the description to the `Active Summary` topic
- Only ask for `full` vs `fast` (no description prompt needed)

For concrete parsing examples and expected behavior per command shape, read `references/EXAMPLES.md` (Argument Parsing).

---

## Full Mode

### Step 1: Parse Description & Quick Reconnaissance

From the description, extract:
- Core functionality being added
- Key domain terms
- Type (feature, enhancement, fix, refactor)

**Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type: Explore` to quickly understand the relevant parts of the codebase.** This runs as a subagent and keeps the main context clean.

Based on the parsed description, launch 1-2 Explore agents in parallel:

```
Task(subagent_type: Explore, model: sonnet, prompt:
  "In [project root], find files and modules related to [feature domain keywords].
   Report: key directories, relevant files, existing patterns, integration points.
   Thoroughness: quick. Be concise — return a structured summary, not file contents.")
```

**Rules:**
- 1-2 agents max, "quick" thoroughness — this is reconnaissance, not deep analysis
- Deep exploration happens later in Step 3
- If `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` already provides sufficient context, this step can be skipped

### Step 1.2: Generate Branch Name

```
Format: <type>/<short-description>

Examples:
- feature/user-authentication
- fix/cart-total-calculation
- refactor/api-error-handling
- chore/upgrade-dependencies
```

**Rules:**
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Max 50 characters
- No special characters except hyphens
- Descriptive but concise

### Step 1.3: Ask About Preferences

**IMPORTANT: Always ask the user before proceeding:**

```
AskUserQuestion: Before we start, a few questions:

1. Should I write tests for this feature?
   a. Yes, write tests
   b. No, skip tests

2. Logging level for implementation:
   a. Verbose (recommended) - detailed DEBUG logs for development
   b. Standard - INFO level, key events only
   c. Minimal - only WARN/ERROR

3. Documentation policy after implementation?
   a. Yes — mandatory docs checkpoint at completion (recommended)
   b. No — warn-only (`WARN [docs]`), no mandatory checkpoint

4. Roadmap milestone linkage (only if `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists):
   a. Link this plan to a milestone
   b. Skip — no linkage (allowed; `/aif-verify --strict` should report WARN, not fail, for missing linkage alone)

5. Any specific requirements or constraints?
```

**Default to verbose logging.** AI-generated code benefits greatly from extensive logging because:
- Subtle bugs are common and hard to trace without logs
- Users can always remove logs later
- Missing logs during development wastes debugging time

Store all preferences — they will be used in the plan file and passed to `/aif-implement`.

Docs policy semantics:
- `Docs: yes` → `/aif-implement` MUST show a mandatory documentation checkpoint and route docs changes through `/aif-docs`
- `Docs: no` (or unset) → `/aif-implement` emits `WARN [docs]` and continues without a mandatory docs checkpoint

**If `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists and the user chose milestone linkage:**
- Read `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` and list candidate milestones (prefer unchecked items)
- Ask the user to pick one milestone (or type a custom one)
- Store the selected milestone name and a 1-sentence rationale for inclusion in the plan file

### Step 1.4: Create Branch or Worktree

**If `--parallel` flag is set → create worktree:**

#### Worktree Creation

```bash
DIRNAME=$(basename "$(pwd)")
git branch <branch-name> main
git worktree add ../${DIRNAME}-<branch-name-with-hyphens> <branch-name>
```

Convert branch name for directory: replace `/` with `-`.

**Example:**
```
Project dir: my-project
Branch: feature/user-auth
Worktree: ../my-project-feature-user-auth
```

Copy context files so the worktree has full AI context:

```bash
WORKTREE="../${DIRNAME}-<branch-name-with-hyphens>"

# Ensure AI Factory directories exist before copy operations
mkdir -p "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory"
mkdir -p "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/plans"
mkdir -p "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/patches"
mkdir -p "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/evolutions"

# Project context
cp .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md" 2>/dev/null
cp .ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md" 2>/dev/null
cp .ai-factory/RESEARCH.md "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md" 2>/dev/null

# Skill-context (primary learning context)
cp -r .ai-factory/skill-context/ "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/skill-context/" 2>/dev/null

# Note: do not copy patch-cursor.json into a truncated patch set.
# The parallel worktree copies only a limited number of patches for fallback context.
# Copying the evolve cursor without the full patch history can cause /aif-evolve to skip patches
# or trigger a partial rescan.

# Limited patch fallback: copy only recent patches (latest 10 by filename)
for patch in $(ls -1 .ai-factory/patches/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -n 10); do
  cp "${patch}" "${WORKTREE}/.ai-factory/patches/"
done

# Agent skills + settings
cp -r .claude/ "${WORKTREE}/.claude/" 2>/dev/null

# CLAUDE.md only if untracked
if [ -f CLAUDE.md ] && ! git ls-files --error-unmatch CLAUDE.md &>/dev/null; then
  cp CLAUDE.md "${WORKTREE}/CLAUDE.md"
fi
```

Create changes directory and switch:

```bash
cd "${WORKTREE}"
```

Display confirmation:

```
Parallel worktree created!

  Branch:    <branch-name>
  Directory: <worktree-path>

To manage worktrees later:
  /aif-plan --list
  /aif-plan --cleanup <branch-name>
```

Continue to Step 2.

**If no `--parallel` → create branch normally:**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

If branch already exists, ask user:
- Switch to existing branch?
- Create with different name?

---

## Fast Mode

### Step 1: Ask About Preferences

Ask a shorter set of questions:

```
AskUserQuestion: Before we start:

1. Should I include tests in the plan?
   a. Yes, include tests
   b. No, skip tests

2. Any specific requirements or constraints?

3. Roadmap milestone linkage (only if `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists):
   a. Link this plan to a milestone
   b. Skip — no linkage (allowed; `/aif-verify --strict` should report WARN, not fail, for missing linkage alone)
```

**Plan file:** Always `.ai-factory/PLAN.md` (no branch, no branch-named file).

---

## Shared Steps (both modes)

### Step 2: Analyze Requirements

From the description, identify:
- Core functionality to implement
- Components/files that need changes
- Dependencies between tasks
- Edge cases to handle

If requirements are ambiguous, ask clarifying questions:
```
I need a few clarifications before creating the plan:
1. [Specific question about scope]
2. [Question about approach]
```

### Step 3: Explore Codebase

Before planning, understand the existing code through **parallel exploration**.

**Use `Task` tool with `subagent_type: Explore` to investigate the codebase in parallel.** This keeps the main context clean and speeds up research.

Launch 2-3 Explore agents simultaneously, each focused on a different aspect:

```
Agent 1 — Architecture & affected modules:
Task(subagent_type: Explore, model: sonnet, prompt:
  "Find files and modules related to [feature domain]. Map the directory structure,
   key entry points, and how modules interact. Thoroughness: medium.")

Agent 2 — Existing patterns & conventions:
Task(subagent_type: Explore, model: sonnet, prompt:
  "Find examples of similar functionality already implemented in the project.
   Show patterns for [relevant patterns: API endpoints, services, models, etc.].
   Thoroughness: medium.")

Agent 3 — Dependencies & integration points (if needed):
Task(subagent_type: Explore, model: sonnet, prompt:
  "Find all files that import/use [module/service]. Identify integration points
   and potential side effects of changes. Thoroughness: medium.")
```

**If full mode passed codebase reconnaissance** from Step 1 — use it as a starting point. Focus Explore agents on areas that need deeper understanding.

**After agents return, synthesize:**
- Which files need to be created/modified
- What patterns to follow (from existing code)
- Dependencies between components
- Potential risks or edge cases

**Fallback:** If Task tool is unavailable, use Glob/Grep/Read directly.

### Step 4: Create Task Plan

Create tasks using `TaskCreate` with clear, actionable items.

**Task Guidelines:**
- Each task should be completable in one focused session
- Tasks should be ordered by dependency (do X before Y)
- Include file paths where changes will be made
- Be specific about what to implement, not vague

Use `TaskUpdate` to set `blockedBy` relationships:
- Task 2 blocked by Task 1 if it depends on Task 1's output
- Keep dependency chains logical

### Step 5: Save Plan to File

**Determine plan file path:**
- **Fast mode** → `.ai-factory/PLAN.md`
- **Full mode** → `.ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md` (replace `/` with `-`)

**Before saving, ensure directory exists:**
```bash
mkdir -p .ai-factory/plans  # only when saving to branch-named plan files
```

**Plan file must include:**
- Title with feature name
- Branch and creation date
- `Settings` section (Testing, Logging, Docs)
- `Roadmap Linkage` section (optional, only if `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists)
- `Research Context` section (optional, if `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md` exists)
- `Tasks` section grouped by phases
- `Commit Plan` section when there are 5+ tasks

If `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists:
- If the user linked a milestone, write `## Roadmap Linkage` with `Milestone: "..."` and `Rationale: ...`
- If the user skipped linkage, write `## Roadmap Linkage` with `Milestone: "none"` and `Rationale: "Skipped by user"`

If `.ai-factory/RESEARCH.md` exists:
- Include `## Research Context` by copying only the `Active Summary` (do not paste full `Sessions`)
- Keep it compact; it should be readable as a one-screen requirements snapshot

Use the canonical template in `references/TASK-FORMAT.md` (Plan File Template).

**Commit Plan Rules:**
- **5+ tasks** → add commit checkpoints every 3-5 tasks
- **Less than 5 tasks** → single commit at the end, no commit plan needed
- Group logically related tasks into one commit
- Suggest meaningful commit messages following conventional commits

### Step 6: Next Steps

**Full mode + parallel (`--parallel`):** Automatically invoke `/aif-implement` — the whole point of parallel is autonomous end-to-end execution in an isolated worktree.

```
/aif-implement

CONTEXT FROM /aif-plan:
- Plan file: .ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md
- Testing: yes/no
- Logging: verbose/standard/minimal
- Docs: yes/no  # yes => mandatory docs checkpoint, no => warn-only
```

**Full mode normal:** STOP after planning. The user reviews the plan and decides when to implement.

```
Plan created with [N] tasks.
Plan file: .ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md

To start implementation, run:
/aif-implement

To view tasks:
/tasks (or use TaskList)
```

**Fast mode:** STOP after planning.

```
Plan created with [N] tasks.
Plan file: .ai-factory/PLAN.md

To start implementation, run:
/aif-implement

To view tasks:
/tasks (or use TaskList)
```

### Context Cleanup

Suggest the user to free up context space if needed: `/clear` (full reset) or `/compact` (compress history).

---

## --list Subcommand

When `--list` is passed, show all active worktrees and their feature status. Then **STOP**.

```bash
git worktree list
```

For each worktree path:
1. Check if `<worktree>/.ai-factory/plans/` contains any plan files
2. Show name and whether it looks complete (has tasks) or is still in progress

**Output format:**
```
Active worktrees:

  /path/to/my-project          (main)        <- you are here
  /path/to/my-project-feature-user-auth  (feature/user-auth)  -> Plan: feature-user-auth.md
  /path/to/my-project-fix-cart-bug       (fix/cart-bug)        -> No plan yet
```

## --cleanup Subcommand

When `--cleanup <branch>` is passed, remove the worktree and optionally delete the branch. Then **STOP**.

```bash
DIRNAME=$(basename "$(pwd)")
BRANCH_DIR=$(echo "<branch>" | tr '/' '-')
WORKTREE="../${DIRNAME}-${BRANCH_DIR}"

git worktree remove "${WORKTREE}"
git branch -d <branch>  # -d (not -D) will fail if unmerged, which is safe
```

If `git branch -d` fails because the branch is unmerged:

```
Branch <branch> has unmerged changes.
To force-delete: git branch -D <branch>
To merge first: git checkout main && git merge <branch>
```

If the worktree path doesn't exist, check `git worktree list` and suggest the correct path.

---

## Task Description Requirements

Every `TaskCreate` item MUST include:
- Clear deliverable and expected behavior
- File paths to change/create
- Logging requirements (what to log, where, and levels)
- Dependency notes when applicable

**Never create tasks without logging instructions.**

Use canonical examples in `references/TASK-FORMAT.md`:
- TaskCreate Example
- Logging Requirements Checklist

## Important Rules

1. **NO tests if user said no** — Don't sneak in test tasks
2. **NO reports** — Don't create summary/report tasks at the end
3. **Actionable tasks** — Each task should have clear deliverable
4. **Right granularity** — Not too big (overwhelming), not too small (noise)
5. **Dependencies matter** — Order tasks so they can be done sequentially
6. **Include file paths** — Help implementer know where to work
7. **Commit checkpoints for large plans** — 5+ tasks need commit plan with checkpoints every 3-5 tasks
8. **Plan file location** — Fast mode: `.ai-factory/PLAN.md`. Full mode: `.ai-factory/plans/<branch-name>.md`
9. **Ownership boundary** — This command owns plan files only (`.ai-factory/PLAN.md`, `.ai-factory/plans/<branch>.md`). Use owner commands (`/aif-roadmap`, `/aif-rules`, `/aif-explore`) for their artifacts.
10. **Roadmap linkage (when available)** — If `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` exists, include a `## Roadmap Linkage` section in the plan (or explicitly state it was skipped).

## Plan File Handling

**Fast mode (`.ai-factory/PLAN.md`)**
- Temporary plan for quick work
- `/aif-implement` may offer deletion after completion

**Full mode (`.ai-factory/plans/<branch>.md`)**
- Branch-scoped, long-lived plan for feature delivery
- Used to resume work from current branch context

For concrete end-to-end flows (fast/full/full+parallel/interactive), read `references/EXAMPLES.md` (Flow Scenarios).
